### Atrributions
- Patrick showed my how to use CDN to intall the library.
- I learnt how to hide a ``` <p>``` from w3school. and what a ``` $(document).ready(function()``` is.
## Code Journal.
- In this assignment, the idea is learn how to install a plugin.
- My choice is to use Jquery as my plugin.
- At very beginning, I went to jquery website and try to download one directly, but everytime I hit download the browser will pop up a new window and shows a lot of unreadable code.
- So I asked some help from Patrick, he explained my the best way to do this is using CDN(google CDNjs jquery). Then just copy the link and paste to my ``` <header>```. Thanks Patrick!
- Then I went to w3school website, and learnt how to hide a paragraph when I hit a button which is ``` $(document).ready(function()```
- Was pretty cool.  I will keep working hard on JS studies. A little complicated to me for now. Fighting!
